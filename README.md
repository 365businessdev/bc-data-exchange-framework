# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central - Data Exchange Framework Extension

## What is Microsofts Data Exchange Framework?

You can use the Data Exchange Framework to manage the exchange of business documents, bank files, currency exchange rates, and any other data files with your business partners or authorities.

As an administrator or Microsoft partner, you can use the framework in new integration features by setting up which data to exchange and how. For example, the format of files for exchange of data in bank files, electronic documents, currency exchange rates, and other with ERP systems vary depending on the provider of the data file or stream and on the country/region. Business Central supports various bank file formats and data service standards. To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the data exchange framework.
